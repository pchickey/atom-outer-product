Atom Outer Product
Pat Hickey
24 Oct 2010

I wrote this code[1] to play with Tom Hawkins's[2] Atom[3,4], an embedded Haskell DSL. This is a
simple example project which generates C code to calculate the outer product of a vector with 
itself; that is, a^T * a, which multiplies each element of a by each element of a. Presently the
code is implemented for a length 4 input.

I have implemented this simple algorithm in two ways: 
1. 'outerprod', which iterates across the input and performs the calculation using atom expressions
2. 'betterop', which iterates across the input at using Haskell expressions (that is, at compile 
    time), and performs the calculation using atom expressions.
    
I'm sure there are many obvious improvements to be made, not the least of which is to only calculate
one triangle of the symmetric output matrix. Hopefully this code will be a useful example on how
to use Atom. 
    
I've provided two C wrappers for the compiled Atom code:
1.  funcTestPrePostCode, which performs an outer product of a vector given as an argument to the 
    compiled C program. I used this to verify the code works.
2.  benchTestPrePostCode, which performs a rudimentary execution time test. It demonstrates that
    betterop is several times faster than outerprod, as you would expect.
